# Note Maker
A cli tool to take notes and learn C

A very trivial cli tool to create notes with a config file for some options. The purpose was to start getting comfortable with C and understand it a bit more.

### Usage
- build the project
- run the binary
- follow prompts and create note.

### Config options:

- save_path, path to save the notes.
- add_dates, if true will append a date and time to the note name.


### Note

The config file (nmrc) needs to be in the same location as the binary, I have not set a designated location like with other cli tools. ( Project is for learning not to really be used. )
